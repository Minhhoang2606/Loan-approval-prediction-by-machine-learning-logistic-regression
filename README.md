# Loan Approval Prediction Model

This project aims to build a classification model to predict whether a loan will be approved or denied. The dataset used is a small loan dataset found on Kaggle, containing 61 entries with various features such as age, gender, occupation, educational level, marital status, income, credit score, and loan status. Despite the small size, the steps and processes for building the model remain consistent with larger datasets.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Workflow

The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Exploration and Pre-processing**
2. **Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets**
3. **Model Building**
4. **Model Evaluation**
5. **Making Predictions with Unseen Data**
6. **Cross-Validation**
7. **Addressing Model Overfitting and Imbalance**

## Data Exploration and Pre-processing

1. **Load Data:**
   - Read the CSV file containing the loan data using pandas.
   - Display the first few rows and check the data types and missing values.

2. **Check for Missing Values:**
   - Use `df.isnull().sum()` to identify any missing data.
   - Handle missing values appropriately, considering the small size of the dataset.

3. **Encode Categorical Variables:**
   - Use one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values.
   - Apply `pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)` to avoid the dummy variable trap.

4. **Separate Features and Target Variable:**
   - Separate the dataset into independent variables (X) and the target variable (y).

## Model Building

1. **Split Data:**
   - Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Example: `train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`

2. **Initialize and Train the Model:**
   - Initialize the logistic regression model: `model = LogisticRegression()`
   - Train the model with the training data: `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`

## Evaluation and Cross-Validation

1. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set: `y_pred = model.predict(X_test)`

2. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report using `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, and `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics`.

3. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Perform cross-validation using `cross_val_score` to evaluate the model's performance across different subsets of the data.
   - Example: `cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)`

## Making Predictions

1. **Create New Data:**
   - Create a new dataframe with the same structure as the training data, filling it with zeroes initially.
   - Populate the new dataframe with actual values for prediction.

2. **Make Predictions with New Data:**
   - Use the trained model to predict the loan status of the new data.
   - Interpret the results and determine whether the loan is approved or denied.

## Addressing Model Overfitting and Imbalance

1. **Check for Data Imbalance:**
   - Analyze the distribution of the target variable to identify any imbalance.

2. **Implement Techniques to Address Overfitting and Imbalance:**
   - **Feature Scaling:** Ensure all features are on the same scale.
   - **Regularization:** Penalize large coefficients to reduce the influence of any single feature.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Transform features to reduce their range or improve their relevance.
   - **Data Balancing:** Use techniques like SMOTE to synthesize new samples and balance the dataset.

3. **Feature Importance Visualization:**
   - Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the importance of different features in the model.

From the SHAP values plot, we can observe that the credit score is the most important feature in predicting whether your loan will be approved or denied. It's somewhat amusing that after conducting all this analysis, we arrive at a conclusion that aligns with our logical understanding of the data. Naturally, bankers heavily rely on credit scores when deciding whether to approve a loan or not.

We also notice that our target variable is heavily imbalanced. There are several methods to address this disproportionate feature influence:

-  **Feature Scaling:** Ensuring that all features are on the same scale. For example, while your credit score is already numeric, it has a much larger range compared to other features. Consider house-related features: square meters can be in the thousands, whereas the number of rooms is typically a single digit. Both are numeric, but on vastly different scales.

-  **Regularization:** This technique penalizes large coefficients, thereby reducing the influence of any single feature.

-  **Feature Engineering:** Transforming some features to reduce their range. For example, applying a log transformation to the credit score can achieve this.

-  **Feature Selection:** Manually selecting a subset of features that are less correlated with each other and with the target variable.

-  **Balancing the Dataset:** Using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to synthesize new data. Although we have only 61 rows, we can create more instances of approved loans to balance the dataset. This adjustment of class weights can help the model learn better.

By employing these techniques, we can mitigate the overbearing influence of any single feature and improve the model's predictive performance.
